Class

A class is really nothing more than a C struct, but what is special about it is that it contains two
different kinds of features: data (attributes) and behavioral

Objects

Objects are instances of classes, in the same way that a specific variable x (of type int) is an
instance of its type (int). The same set of operators (such as arithmetic operators) apply to
all variables of that type, but the specific values of one instance differ from another instance
(say, y).

Embedded system are created for the the different system( the host). So tools used in the craetion of the embedded system. That tool is crosscompiler. . This is a compiler that
runs on the host but creates executable code that runs on a different computer and operating
environment. Many real-time operating systems (RTOSs) provide their own proprietary compilers or provide customizations for open-source compilers such as GCC 

A linker is a program that combines a set of executable codes together into an executable for a
target. Some operating systems donâ€™t require an explicit link step because the OS loader
dynamically links the program elements as it loads into memory.The
linker often relocates the program as well, meaning that the start address is specified during the
link step and assembly language jump instructions must be updated to reflect the actual starting
base address

A loader is a tool that loads the object image output from the linking step into the memory of
the target environment. This may be done via a serial or network link or by burning the
software image into nonvolatile memory such as Flash or EPROM. As an alternative to loading
the software image on a target platform, many developers use simulators for the target that
execute on their host development systems. It is common, for example, to use Z80 or 8051
simulators running on Windows to begin to run, debug, and test your software even before
target boards are available.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) link together most or all of the tools
in the embedded tool chain to facilitate and automate the development process. The latest
industry trend is to host the IDEs in the Eclipse platform4 because of the power of the integrated
environment and the availability of third-party and open-source plug-ins.

for example:-
Class Sensor with data elements value, updateFrequency, and
filterFrequency and operations, getValue(), setValue(v: int), setUpdateFreq
(r:int), getUpdateFreq(), setFilterFreq(ff: int), and getFilterFreq().

Note : in the embedded system, there should be one instance of the class running. Usually 
more data centric and server centric have multiple instance.
