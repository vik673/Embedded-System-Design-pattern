# Deadlock Pattern in Embedded Systems

## Overview
The Deadlock Pattern demonstrates scenarios where two or more threads are permanently blocked, waiting for each other to release resources. This pattern is crucial in embedded systems where resource constraints and real-time requirements make deadlocks particularly problematic.

## Deadlock Conditions (Coffman Conditions)
A deadlock occurs when all four conditions are met simultaneously:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources cannot be shared
2. **Hold and Wait**: Threads hold resources while waiting for others
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads
4. **Circular Wait**: Circular chain of threads waiting for resources

## Pattern Components

### 1. Resource Classes
- `SharedResource`: Represents a resource that can be locked
- `ResourceManager`: Manages multiple resources and provides deadlock prevention

### 2. Deadlock Scenarios
- **Classic Deadlock**: Two threads acquiring locks in different orders
- **Banking Problem**: Multiple threads accessing account resources
- **Dining Philosophers**: Classic synchronization problem

### 3. Prevention Techniques
- **Lock Ordering**: Always acquire locks in the same order
- **Timeout-based Locking**: Use timeouts to break potential deadlocks
- **Deadlock Detection**: Monitor and detect circular wait conditions
- **Resource Allocation Graph**: Visualize resource dependencies

## Use Cases in Embedded Systems
- Multi-threaded device drivers accessing shared hardware
- Real-time systems with multiple priority levels
- Communication protocols with bidirectional data flow
- Memory management in resource-constrained environments

## Implementation Features
- Thread-safe resource management
- Deadlock detection algorithms
- Prevention strategies
- Performance monitoring
- Real-time compatibility

## Compilation
```bash
make clean
make all
./deadlock_demo
```

## Example Output
The demo will show:
1. Deadlock scenario creation
2. Detection mechanisms
3. Prevention strategies
4. Performance impact analysis

## Best Practices
1. Always acquire locks in consistent order
2. Use timeouts for lock acquisition
3. Minimize lock holding time
4. Prefer lock-free algorithms when possible
5. Monitor system for deadlock conditions
