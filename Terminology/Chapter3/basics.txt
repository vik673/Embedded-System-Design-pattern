software-accessible hardware can be categorized into four kinds â€“ infrastructure, communications, sensors, and actuators.

Infrastructure hardware refers to the computing infrastructure and devices on which the software is executing. 
This includes not only the CPU and memory, but also storage devices,
timers, input devices (such as keyboards, knobs, and buttons), user output devices (printers,
displays, and lights), ports, and interrupts. Most of this hardware is not particularly application
specific and may be located on the same motherboard, on daughterboards with high-speed
access connections, or as other boards sharing a common backplane.


Sensors use electronic, mechanical, or chemical means for monitoring the status of
physical phenomena, such as the rate of a heart beat, position of an aircraft, the mass of an object,
or the concentration of a chemical. Actuators, on the other hand, change the physical state of
some real-world element. Typical actuators are motors, heaters, generators, pumps, and switches.
