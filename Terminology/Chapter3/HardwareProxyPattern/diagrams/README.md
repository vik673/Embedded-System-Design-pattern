# Hardware Proxy Pattern

## Overview
The **Hardware Proxy Pattern** provides a structured way to interact with hardware devices by abstracting their interfaces. It ensures that the peculiarities of the hardware are hidden from the client, allowing the client to interact with the hardware through a clean and consistent interface.

---

## Abstract
- The **Hardware Proxy** acts as the primary class or function in the system, customized to the specific hardware device.
- It provides public functions for:
  - Initializing, configuring, and disabling the device.
  - Reading values from the device.
  - Writing values to the device.
- Internal functions handle data formatting (e.g., marshaling and unmarshaling) to ensure compatibility between the client and the hardware.

---

## Problem
- Hardware devices often have complex and inconsistent interfaces.
- Direct interaction with hardware can lead to tightly coupled and hard-to-maintain code.
- The **Hardware Proxy Pattern** solves this by:
  - Providing a clean interface for the client.
  - Hiding the details of hardware interaction.

---

## Pattern Structure
The pattern consists of the following components:
1. **Public Functions**:
   - `initialize()`: Enables and initializes the device.
   - `configure()`: Configures the device with specific parameters.
   - `disable()`: Safely disables the device.
   - `access()`: Reads values from the device.
   - `mutate()`: Writes values to the device.
2. **Internal Functions**:
   - `marshal()`: Converts client data format to hardware-native format.
   - `unmarshal()`: Converts hardware-native format to client data format.
3. **Private Data**:
   - `deviceAddr`: Provides low-level access to the hardware.

## Class Diagram Explanation
The class diagram represents the structure of the **Hardware Proxy Pattern**:

1. **HardwareProxy**:
   - The primary class that interacts with the hardware.
   - Provides public functions for initialization, configuration, and data access.
   - Uses private functions (`marshal()` and `unmarshal()`) for data formatting.

2. **Client**:
   - Interacts with the `HardwareProxy` to control or monitor the hardware.
   - Does not need to know the details of hardware interaction.

## Sequence Diagram Explanation
The sequence diagram illustrates the flow of operations in the **Hardware Proxy Pattern**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The client initializes the hardware using the `initialize()` function.

2. **Configuration**:
   - The client configures the hardware using the `configure()` function.

3. **Data Access**:
   - The client reads or writes data using the `access()` or `mutate()` functions.
   - The `HardwareProxy` uses `marshal()` and `unmarshal()` to format the data.

## Commands

### Compile the Code
```bash
gcc -o HardwareProxyPattern.exe HardwareProxy.c Client.c
```

### Execute the Code
```bash
./HardwareProxyPattern.exe
```

## Summary
The **Hardware Proxy Pattern** simplifies hardware interaction by providing a clean and consistent interface. It hides the complexities of hardware communication, improving maintainability and scalability.
```

## Demo Features
The demo application demonstrates:
1. Motor configuration and initialization
2. Speed and direction control
3. Enable/disable functionality
4. Error handling and validation
5. Different arm length configurations
6. Status monitoring and reporting

## Benefits of This Pattern
1. **Encapsulation**: Hardware details are completely hidden from clients
2. **Reusability**: Same interface can work with different hardware implementations
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to hardware interface don't affect client code
4. **Safety**: Input validation and error handling protect against invalid operations
5. **Performance**: Efficient bit-packing for hardware communication

This implementation follows embedded systems best practices and provides a robust foundation for hardware device control in embedded applications.
