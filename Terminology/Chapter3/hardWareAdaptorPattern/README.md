# Hardware Adapter Pattern Implementation

This implementation demonstrates the Hardware Adapter Pattern as described in embedded system design patterns. The pattern provides a way to adapt an existing hardware interface into the expectations of the application.

## Pattern Overview

The Hardware Adapter Pattern is useful when:
- The application requires one interface, but the actual hardware provides another
- You want to minimize code reworking when replacing hardware implementations
- You need to hide hardware-specific interfaces from client code

## Key Components

### 1. HardwareInterfaceToClient
- Abstract interface that defines what the client expects from the hardware
- Provides a standardized API: `startOperation()`, `stopOperation()`, `getStatus()`, `configure()`

### 2. HardwareDevice
- Represents the actual hardware with its specific interface
- Has hardware-specific methods like `powerOn()`, `powerOff()`, `readDeviceState()`
- Simulates real hardware behavior

### 3. HardwareProxy
- Provides a software representation of the hardware device
- Translates between software calls and hardware-specific operations
- Acts as an abstraction layer over the hardware device

### 4. HardwareAdapter
- **Core of the pattern** - performs "impedance matching"
- Implements the client interface while delegating to the hardware proxy
- Converts client requests into appropriate hardware proxy calls
- Can transform data formats and parameter structures

### 5. AdapterClient
- Uses the hardware through the expected interface
- Completely unaware of the actual hardware implementation details
- Can work with any adapter that implements the client interface

### 6. AlternativeHardwareAdapter
- Demonstrates how different hardware can be used with the same client
- Shows the flexibility and reusability benefits of the pattern

## Pattern Benefits

1. **Interface Compatibility**: Allows incompatible hardware interfaces to work with existing client code
2. **Hardware Abstraction**: Hides hardware-specific details from the application
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to replace hardware without changing client code
4. **Reusability**: Same client code can work with different hardware implementations
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to hardware interface don't affect client code

## How to Build and Run

### Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the project
make

# Run the demonstration
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Manual Compilation
```bash
# Compile manually
g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o hardware_adapter_demo main.cpp HardwareAdapterPattern.cpp

# Run the executable
./hardware_adapter_demo
```

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
# Compile
g++ -std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o hardware_adapter_demo.exe main.cpp HardwareAdapterPattern.cpp

# Run
.\hardware_adapter_demo.exe
```

## Example Output

The demonstration shows:
1. **Original Hardware Implementation**: Shows how the adapter converts client calls to hardware proxy operations
2. **Alternative Hardware Implementation**: Demonstrates different hardware working with the same client code
3. **Pattern Benefits**: Lists the advantages gained from using this pattern

## Real-World Applications

This pattern is commonly used in:
- **Device Drivers**: Adapting hardware-specific interfaces to OS-standard interfaces
- **Sensor Integration**: Making different sensor types work with the same application code
- **Communication Protocols**: Adapting between different communication standards
- **Legacy Hardware**: Integrating old hardware with new systems
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Making hardware-dependent code work across different platforms

## Key Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension (new adapters) but closed for modification
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Client depends on abstraction, not concrete implementations
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces without unnecessary dependencies

This implementation provides a robust foundation for hardware abstraction in embedded systems while maintaining flexibility and maintainability.
