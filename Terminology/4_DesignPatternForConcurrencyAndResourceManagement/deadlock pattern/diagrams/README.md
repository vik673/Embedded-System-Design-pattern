# Deadlock Pattern in Embedded Systems

## Overview
The **Deadlock Pattern** demonstrates scenarios where two or more threads become permanently blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource. In embedded systems, this is particularly problematic due to resource constraints and real-time requirements.

## Deadlock Conditions (Coffman Conditions)
A deadlock occurs when all four of the following conditions hold simultaneously:
1. **Mutual Exclusion:** Resources cannot be shared.
2. **Hold and Wait:** Threads hold one resource while waiting for others.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads.
4. **Circular Wait:** A closed chain of threads exists, where each thread holds a resource needed by the next.

## Pattern Components

### 1. Resource Classes
- **SharedResource:** Represents a resource that can be locked or unlocked.
- **ResourceManager:** Manages multiple resources and can incorporate techniques for deadlock prevention.

### 2. Deadlock Scenarios
- **Classic Deadlock:** Two threads acquire locks in opposite orders, leading to a circular wait.
- **Banking Problem:** Multiple threads attempt to access and modify shared account resources.
- **Dining Philosophers:** A common synchronization problem where philosophers (threads) share limited resources (forks).

### 3. Prevention Techniques
- **Lock Ordering:** Always acquire multiple locks in a predefined order.
- **Timeout-based Locking:** Use timeouts to prevent indefinite waiting.
- **Deadlock Detection:** Identify circular wait conditions and take corrective action.
- **Resource Allocation Graphs:** Visualize resource dependencies to prevent cycles.

## Use Cases
- Multi-threaded device drivers accessing shared hardware.
- Real-time systems with multiple priority tasks.
- Communication protocols with bidirectional resource sharing.
- Memory management in resource-constrained environments.

## Implementation Features
- Thread-safe resource management.
- Deadlock detection and prevention mechanisms.
- Performance monitoring and real-time compatibility.

## Class Diagram Explanation
The class diagram (see *ClassDiagram.puml*) illustrates a simplified model of a deadlock scenario:
- **Thread:** Represents a concurrent execution context that can acquire and release resources.
- **SharedResource:** Encapsulates a resource that a thread may lock and unlock.
- The association between **Thread** and **SharedResource** indicates that threads may hold or request locks on resources. If two threads hold locks on different resources and each waits on the other's resource, a deadlock occurs.

## Sequence Diagram Explanation
The sequence diagram (see *SequenceDiagram.puml*) demonstrates a classic deadlock scenario:
1. **Thread A** acquires **Resource 1**.
2. **Thread B** acquires **Resource 2**.
3. **Thread A** then attempts to acquire **Resource 2**, which is already held by **Thread B**.
4. **Thread B** concurrently attempts to acquire **Resource 1**, which is held by **Thread A**.
5. This mutual waiting results in a circular wait â€“ a deadlock.

## Compilation
```bash
make clean
make all
./deadlock_demo
```

## Example Output
The demo will display:
1. A deadlock scenario where threads await resources held by each other.
2. Detection or prevention messages (if implemented).
3. Analysis of performance impact.

## Best Practices
1. Acquire locks in a consistent order.
2. Use timeouts for lock acquisition.
3. Minimize the duration for which locks are held.
4. Prefer lock-free algorithms when possible.
5. Monitor the system to detect potential deadlocks.
